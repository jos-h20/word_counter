input: "a" (word being searched) and "a" (string being searched in)
expect result to be "1"; (result is the number of times word appears in string.)

why: matching one letter seems to be most basic.

input: a and b
expect result to be 0;

why: checking a fail against one letter seems most basic.

input: a and a b
expect result to be 1;

why: checking a search between different letters is simple.

input: a and a a
expect result to be 2;

why: checking a search between two of the same letters is simple.

input: ab and ab
expect result to be 1;

why: checking a search against a two letter word is about as reductionist as you can get for multi-character word.

input: ab and ba
expect result to be 0;

why: checking a fail against a two letter word seems the most basic way to go.

input: ab and ab ba ab
expect result to be 2;

why: checking a matching search among multiple words with two letters is really pretty simple.

input: ab and ba da ca
expect result to be 0;

why: checking a fail search among multiple two-character words is basic.

input: Ab and bA DA aB
expect result to be 1;

why: two letter words with varied letters capitalized is the simplest way to check if the strtolower function is working.
